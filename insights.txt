Explain how the app works and the different concepts that were used to learn faster.

    EXPRESS
* routes
* chaining routes (next())

    MIDDLEWARE
What is middelware?
Anything between the request and the response.

* serve public static files
* middleware (custom, built-in, 3rd parties)
* CORS
* request logs
* errors logs
* app.use
* app.all

    ROUTING
* purpose =  breaking the multiple routes from server into individual routers
* REST API 
    - created the /routes/api/users.js do demonstrate how REST API can be created with NodeJS and Express
    - on this routes we dont't need static files because we respond with json data from API

    MVC REST API
* we wont serve static files when creating a REST API - view directory will contain mostly 1-2 views
* the purpose of MVC is to separate the logic into multiple files, each of it handling specific task
* data is kept in the model folder
* controllers folder handles bussiness logic

//creating /users route to demonstrate how we can use Express to create a REST API. 
It is likely to use Express for this purpose rather than serve static files as we do in the previous routes


CORS
//use this middleware when you want your API to be fully available to the public
app.use(cors());
//BUT if you want to protect your API from specific origins, create allowed origins and provide it as cors options
app.use(cors(corsOptions));
